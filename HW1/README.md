As per the question, we are trying to predict the target variable 'y' effectively. Two linear regression models have been developed. Version 1 **`lr_model1.pkl`** is trained using 'x4' as the explanatory variable due to its highest absolute correlation with 'y' (0.524394). Version 2 **`lr_model2.pkl`** incorporates both 'x2' (0.471165 absolute correlation) and 'x4' for improved predictive power. On test data, Model 1 yielded a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 85.07 and a Coefficient of Determination (R-squared) of 0.2752, whereas Model 2 significantly reduced the error to 56.49 and improved R-squared to 51.87%. This indicates Model 2 not only enhances prediction accuracy but also explains a higher proportion of variance in 'y'. Consequently, Model 2 is the designated current model **`lr_current.pkl`**.
